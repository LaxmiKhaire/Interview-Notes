kevel :
1. what is solid principles explain with example and explain where you implementation in your previous project.
 
2. which algorithm garbage collector used in java and why ? explain how it works.
 
3. what is arraylist and what is it's complexity. complexity of arraylist for search based on index is o(1) but if i want to search any element then we have to traverse it right so it will be o(n) which is same as linked list search complexity. but still why linked list is slow than arraylist while traversing in it.
 
4. what happened if string will not be immutable in java? others immutable claases in java apart from string and how string is different from other immutable classes in java.
 
5. how do make global exception in spring boot?
 
if you make it does it will work everywhere in application?
 
if yes then what happen in case of filters? does it will work in filters?
 
6. how filter work and when it will call?
 
methods of filter and their parameters.
 
how filter's doFilter() method parameter works.
 
8.ServletRequest is mutable or immutable? why.
 
as we know wservlet request/response interface has methods like setParametr etc so how it get set if it is immutable?
 
9. explain servlets and how it will work.
 
10. make custome annotation.
 
what is retentionPolicy & ElementType which using while we making custom annotations and what is it's values, explain all values with example.
 
11. what is default method?
 
a. make one interface A with default method abc() and make 2 another interface  B and C with same default methods which implement interface A
 
how do make call A interface default method from interface B.
 
b. now make one interface D with same default method which implement interface B. now how do call interface A default method from interface D.

4. given one scenario like we required date in specific format in each module for every functionality so how we can define it.
 
5. custom annotation and what @Target is doing in it
 
6. same like a String design pattern which another design pattern works
 
7. suppose we have 100 records on service level and some records already present in db from that 100 records, now we need to find best way to store remaining new records in mongodb without finding one by one record from db (do this in scheduler job)
 
8. how to identify accurate logs for exception as raised by client from huge logs
 
9. where we use singleton design pattern apart from database
 
-------------------------------------------------------
1. Solid principles
 
2. how to handle global exceptions
 
3. One scenario based question related to a collection, suppose there is toll booth whrere multiple car was passing by, and threre is ambulance with having high priority which needs 4. to be passed first which collection do you use.
 
5. Explain Dependency Inversion Principle with example
