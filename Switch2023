3. Exception Hierarchy
4. Collection Hierarchy
5. how to handle Exceptions in java -> try,catch,finally,throw,throws
6. Custom exception in java - how to create it and will it be a checked exception or unchecked exception
    All exceptions must be a child of Throwable. If you want to write a checked exception that is automatically enforced by the Handle or Declare Rule, 
    you need to extend the Exception class. 
    If you want to write a runtime exception, you need to extend the RuntimeException class.
6. can we call child class method using parent referance NO
	why? 
	Imagine that your child class is inheriting the parent class. Then the child class can define it's own methods, 
  that are not defined in the parent class and not inherited by  the child class. Java compiler checks compile time polymorphism. 
  There, if you are calling a method of a child object that is defined in the child class itself,  by using a parent reference. 
  Compiler checks whether reference type has the method defined in the reference type class? So there is no such method. see.. compiler gives an error.
